# LyricsPlayerv2.0
a java package with classes to structure a Lyrics Player GUI!

LyricsPlayerv2.0 consists of 4 classes.  Collectively, these classes simplify (e.g. through use of the Comparable interface to sort Song objects alphabetically by artist) creation of a user-defined playlist with a subset of Song Library songs.  In the future, we will use the methods provided in these classes (Song, SongLibrary, MainMenu, PlayList) to provide the underlying structure of a Lyrics Player GUI!
